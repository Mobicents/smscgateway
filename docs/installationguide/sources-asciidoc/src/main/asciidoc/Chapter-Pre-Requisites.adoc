|===
| Component | Requirement | Notes
| System Requirements | Intel Pentium 1 GHz or faster for simple applications. Hard disk space of at least 10GB. RAM of at least 1.5 GB | Higher the RAM and processing power, better is the throughput
| TDM Hardware (Optional) | {this-platform} SMSC Gateway supports legacy E1/T1 links via SS7 cards. You must have dahdi or dialogic cards installed along with their native libraries. {this-platform} SMSC Gateway also supports SIGTRAN (M3UA). | In case if you are connecting to core network via SIGTRAN, TDM hardware is not needed.
| Operating System | The platform can be installed on any OS that supports Java. But native libraries for SS7 cards are compiled only for Linux at the moment and therefore supported only on Linux Operating System.  | The libraries for SS7 cards will be compiled for Windows in future releases. For SIGTRAN the OS should support SCTP protocol.
| Java | You must have a working Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system and it must be version 7. JDK from Oracle is preferred. For wildfly 10 server JRE or JDK version 8 is required.| 
| Database | You must have Cassandra database (version 2.1 last release or later). | See chapter <<_setup_database>> for details. 
| Firewall Access | You must ensure that you have appropriate firewall permissions to allow access to IP:8080. This is required to access the management consoles. | 
| SCTP libraries | If you intend to use SIGTRAN (M3UA), you must have the lksctp library installed. The Linux Kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (lksctp) library provides SCTP implementation. | For more details on downloading and installing lksctp, please refer to http://lksctp.sourceforge.net/
